//Class and Object

//A class is like a blueprint or template for creating an object 
//It has two things 1) variables which is called fields or properties
//                  2)  functionns called methods

//An object is a real-world instance of a class, somthing actually created from blueprint
//Each object has 1) Its own copy of data     2) Access to the same method define in the class.
